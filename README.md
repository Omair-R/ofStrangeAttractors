## What is ofStrangeAttractors?
ofStrangeAttractors is a simple [OpenFrameworks](https://openframeworks.cc/) app/library for procedurally drawing strange attractors. Attractors are dynamical systems whose behaviour tends towards a certain state (you could say they are *attracted* to it :D). Some of these attractors exhibit [fractal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal) behaviour, and are called strange. They are strange and **beautiful**!!

## Features
- Three different *artist* classes for drawing attractors in different ways.
  - **Point space artists**: draw the attractors point by point, it keeps track of all previous points so that the attractor takes shape in real time.
  - **Histogram artist**: an exclusively 2D artist. It is similar to the way [Sportt's maps](https://sprott.physics.wisc.edu/fractals/booktext/SABOOK.PDF#[{%22num%22%3A377%2C%22gen%22%3A0}%2C{%22name%22%3A%22XYZ%22}%2C-7%2C797%2C1]) are drawn; however, this artist places points within a 2D histogram. If you draw them with a gradient spectrum, different frequencies translate to different colors!
  - **Particle artist**: an exclusively 3D artist. Draws multiple particles and moves them along the shape of the attractor.
- Many attractors!
- A simple gradient class to vary drawn colors.
- A very simple implementation of [Sportt's code](https://sprott.physics.wisc.edu/fractals/booktext/SABOOK.PDF#[{%22num%22%3A377%2C%22gen%22%3A0}%2C{%22name%22%3A%22XYZ%22}%2C-7%2C797%2C1]) for high order attractors.

## How can you use it?
This is an [OpenFrameworks](https://openframeworks.cc/) app so you can simply create a folder in you myApps folder and pull the repository to it. There are many commented lines in "main.cpp" you can comment and uncomment different lines and see what will appear on the screen!
